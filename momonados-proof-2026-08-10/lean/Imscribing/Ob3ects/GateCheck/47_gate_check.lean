--   [0] VINIT     dim    := 𐑼               𐑼 → 𐑾  | initial object — ground of distinction
--   [1] AFWD      rel    := 𐑾               𐑼 → 𐑱  | forward morphism — bidirectional arrow
--   [2] CLINK     fid    := 𐑱               𐑾 → 𐑠  | composition — regime coherence
--   [3] IMSCRIB   gram   := 𐑠               𐑱 → 𐑚  | identity — self-imscription
--   [4] FSPLIT    gran   := 𐑚               𐑚 → 𐑚  | split δ — range decomposition
--   [5] EVALT     crit   := ⊙               𐑚 → 𐑙  | evaluate-true — criticality gate open
--   [6] FFUSE     stoi   := 𐑙               𐑙 → 𐑳  | fuse μ — assembly mode
--   [7] ENGAGR    stoi   := 𐑳               𐑙 → 𐑗  | engage paradox — B-state, both arms
--   [8] AREV      pol    := 𐑗               𐑳 → 𐑭  | reverse morphism — parity flip
--   [9] IFIX      prot   := 𐑭               𐑗 → 𐑡  | irreversible fixation — winding number
--   [10] TANCH     top    := 𐑡               𐑭 → 𐑼  | terminal object — connectivity boundary
